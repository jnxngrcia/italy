<h3 align="center" style="color: darkolivegreen;font-size: larger;">The Roman Empire was an international poitical system in which Italy was only a part, though an important part. When the empire fell, a series of barbarian kingdoms initially ruled the peninsula, but after the Lombard invasion of 568-569, a network of smaller political entities arose throughout Italy. How each of these developed-in parallel with the others, out of the ruins of the Roman world-is one principal theme of this section. The survival  and development of the Roman city is another. The urban focus of politics and economic life inherited from the Romans continued and expanded in the early Middle Ages and was unifying element in the development of Italy's regions. The military emperors of the lare 3rd century, most notably Diocletian (284-305), reformed the political structures of the Roman Empire. They restructed the army after the disasters of the previous 50 years, extensively developed the civil bureaucracy and the ceremonial rituals of imperial rule, and above all, reorganized and enlarged the tax system. The fiscal weight of the late Roman Empire was heavy, given the resources of the period: its major support, the land tax, collected by local city governments, took at least one-fifth, and probably one-third of the agricultural produce. On the other hand, the administration and the army that the tax system paid for reestablished a measure stability for the empire in the 4th century. Central government was not always stable; there were several periods of civil war in the 4th century, notably in the decade after Diocletan's retirement in the years around 390. But succesion disputes had been a normal part of imperial politics since the Julio-Claudians in the 1st century ce; in general, self-confidence in the 4th-century empire was fairly high. Aggresive emperors such as Valentinian I (364-375) could not have imagined that within a century nearly all of the Western Empire was to be under barbarian rule. Nor was this lack of a sense of doom a simple delusion; after all, in the richer Eastern provinces the imperial system held firm for many centuries, in the form of the Byzantine Empire. The Germanic invasion of the years after 400 did not, then, strike at an efeebled political system. But in facing them, ultimately unsuccessfulluy, Roman Emperors and generals found themselves in a steadily weaker position, and much of the coherence of the late Roman state dissolved in the environment of the continuous emergencies of the 5th century. One of the tasks of the historian must be to assess the extent of the survival of the Roman institutions in each of the regions of the West conquered by the Germans, for this varied greatly.

<h3 align="center" style="color: darkolivegreen;font-size: x-large;">The basis of the female national costume of Italy is a pleated skirt (called "gonna"), a white embroided shirt (camicia) and a corsage. The costume was complemented by a bright apron and a head scarf (fazzoleto). These are the main elements of a women's Italian costume, found in all regions of the country. As for the distinguishing features, the costumes varied by the length and color of the skirt, the presence or absence of lace details. Lace was very popular with noble Italians, and the casual clothes of ordinary girls were simple and modest. The male  national costume is much simpler than the female one. It consisted of trousers below the knee and a white shirt. The image was complemented by a short or a sleeveless jacket. The head is covered with "berrite", a woolen hat or a Phyrgian cap.

<h2 align="center" style="color: darkolivegreen;font-size: x-large;">HISTORY OF ITALY'S FLAG</h2>
<h2 align="center"> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg/220px-Flag_of_Italy.svg.png" alt="italy flag" width="400"></h2>
<h3 align="center" style="color: darkolivegreen;font-size: x-large;">A rich history of flags and coats of arms has existed in Italy since at least the 1200s, but the lack of national unification meant that there was no recognized flag representing all Italian-populated areas. The nationalism inspired by the French Revolution led to the formation of political and military groups throughout Italy dedicated to replacing the old autocratic regimes with new governments, but the seeds were also sown for a unified Italian state. The original green-white-red tricolour was presented to the National Guard of the Transpadane Republic (in Lombardy) on October 9, 1796. The colours were supposedly based on those found in the uniforms of the urban militia of Milan. The nearby Cispadane Republic chose the same colours in a horizontal layout—the first authentic Italian national flag, adopted on February 25, 1797. The Cisalpine Republic chose the vertical positioning on May 11, 1798, and thereafter that flag was considered by all Italian nationalists as the true flag of their homeland. Its success was guaranteed by the decree of March 23, 1848, signed by King Charles Albert of Sardinia, ordering Italian troops to carry the tricolour in their battles against the Austrian army. A month later the flag replaced the former national flag of Sardinia, and revolutionaries throughout the Italian peninsula likewise rallied to the green-white-red.

  Italy was finally united in 1870. At that time its green-white-red tricolour bore a shield and cross (and, when used for official purposes, a royal crown) representing the ruling house of Savoy. After June 19, 1946, those symbols were removed from the tricolour following a referendum that ended the monarchy and established the Italian Republic.The tricolour became Italy's national flag in Reggio Emilia on January 7th, 1797, when the Cispadane Republic at the proposal of Deputy Giuseppe Compagnoni, decreed "that the Cispadane Standard or Flag of Three Colours, Green, White and Red shall become universal and that these three Colours also be used in the Cispadane cockade, which must be worn by everybody". But why precisely these three colours? In the Italy of 1796, which was swept by the victorious Napoletic army, almost all the numerous Jacobin-inspired republics that had supplanted the old absolute States had adopted flags featuring three bands of equal dimensions and of varying colours, which were clearly inspired by the French model of 1790.
